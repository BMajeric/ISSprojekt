The Flight Simulator, as suggested in the name, is a video game meant to simulate the flight of a fighter aircraft whose goal is to shoot down an enemy tank placed in the overword. 

The player can control the aircraft by adding thrust using the Shift key, slowing down using the Space key, adjusting the roll (with A and D keys), pitch (with Q and E keys) and jaw (with W and S keys) and finally shooting a missile using the left click of the mouse. 

The goal of the game is to fly out of the hangar, find the enemy tank in the overworld and shoot a missle at it destroying it and finishing the game. 

## Instructions
Clone the project locally and start the "SimulatorLeta.exe" from the "Bin" folder.

## Technologies
- C#
- Unity
  
## Implemented
- Player controls
- Main Menu
- Instancing the tank at different locations (preset or random)
- Tank destruction
- Fighter aircraft destruction (player death)
- Simulation of fire when entering the tanks firing range
- Changing of the time of day (progressively)
- Player Death and Game End
## Problems
- Unrealistical fighter aircraft speed
- Player only has 1 missle
- Player can crash into the walls of the hangar while exiting if they are not careful
## Future Work
- More weapons and ammo
- Different enemies (like other aircrafts)
- More interaction with the enemy tank
- More enemy tanks
- Enemies should be able to shoot down the player
- Different maps and scenarios/conditions
